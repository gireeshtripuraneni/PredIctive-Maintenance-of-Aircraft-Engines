The system also generated detailed alerts (expert rules) and model predictions. Top-critical units (lowest true RUL%) were saved to 'top_10_critical_units.csv'. The distribution chart was saved as 'engine_condition_distribution.png'.

Guidance: Engines in the 'DANGER' group should be prioritized for immediate maintenance. Those in 'WARNING' should be monitored and scheduled for maintenance soon. Engines labeled 'OK' are currently in acceptable condition but should continue to be monitored regularly.
